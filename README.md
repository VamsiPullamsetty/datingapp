In this project, I developed a basic dating application using core Java technologies to demonstrate how backend systems work in real-world apps. The primary goal was to manage user data securely and support features such as registration, login, viewing other users, and setting interests.
To build this, I used the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, a widely used pattern in software development that helps keep the code organised. The UserAccount and Interest classes acted as models, representing the data structures for storing user information and their preferences. 
These models were designed to reflect real-world data, like name, age, gender, and hobbies. The controller, UserAccountController.java, handled incoming user requests. For example, when a user signs up or logs in, the controller processes the data and decides how the system should respond. 
It acts like the appâ€™s receptionist, directing requests to the right part of the program. The data access layer was handled through UserAccountDAO and UserAccountDAOImpl. These components connected the application to the database, allowing it to store and retrieve user profiles. 
I used Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) principles here to interact with a backend database cleanly and securely.
